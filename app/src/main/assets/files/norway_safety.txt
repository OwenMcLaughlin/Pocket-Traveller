Health & safety standards in Norway are generally very high. Hygiene standards in hotels and restaurants are strictly enforced by the government food agency. Tap water is generally of high quality, and perfectly safe to drink anywhere unless warning is clearly given. There is absolutly no need to buy water in a bottle.

Borrelia bacteria transmitted by ticks is an increasing problem in Norway (around the coast from Oslo to Trondheim), borrelia can cause Lyme disease. Inspect skin after walking or playing in tall grass. The common European adder (vipera berus) is found throughout mild parts of Norway and active in warm weather. There are no dangours animals in mainland Norway (note special conditions on Svalbard), although deers can be a road hazard. Lion's man jellyfish is very common and can cause serious discomfort - clean with hot (40 to 45 Cesius), salt water.

Norway has very low crime rates, police doesn't even carry guns. Most crimes are petty thefts and vandalism. Do not leave valuables in your car in public parkings and beware of pickpockets in crowded areas. Violent crimes are extremely rare and visitors have no reason to worry about their personal security. Normal big-city precautions do however apply down-town Oslo (around the the train station) as there is some drug dealing and begging. Note that prostitution is now illegal in Norway. Begging is legal, while drugs are not. Also note that drinking alcohol in the street is not allowed, unless in a restaurant/cafe of course. Common scams are extremely rare, but there are occasional reports of betting in the streets (most certainly a scam or attempts of stealing wallets). In Norway, it is illegal to carry knife (or similarly sharp objects) in a public area (except when necessary for professional use or outdoor activity).
